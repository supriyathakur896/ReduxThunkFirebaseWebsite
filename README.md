# ReduxThunkFirebaseWebsite
Welcome to my First GIT Hub repository. This is a React app and I've used Redux Thunk middleware to call the API and Ive also designed a Sign and SignUp page using a Google authentication and Firestore of Firebase. Hope you all Like it !! and I'll keep doing changes as my learning experiences will improve.
Thank you!!!

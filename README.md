# ReduxThunkFirebaseWebsite
I am very excited to my First GIT Hub repository a React app.I've used Redux Thunk middleware to call the API and I've also designed a Sign and SignUp page using a Google authentication and Firestore of Firebase. Hope you all Like it !! and I'll keep doing changes as my learning experiences will improve.
Thank you!!!
